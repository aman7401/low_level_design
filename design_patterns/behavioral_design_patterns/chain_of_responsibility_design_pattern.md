The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler in the chain decides either to process the request or to pass it along the chain to the next handler.

Real-World Analogy of the Chain Of Responsibility Design Pattern

Imagine a customer support system where customer requests need to be handled based on their priority. There are three levels of support: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 1 support handles basic requests, Level 2 support handles more complex requests, and Level 3 support handles critical issues that cannot be resolved by Level 1 or Level 2.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is beneficial in this situation because it allows us to create a chain of handlers, where each handler can either handle a request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. This way, we can easily add or remove handlers without modifying the client code, providing flexibility and scalability in handling customer requests.


```java 

abstract class Logger {
    public static int INFO = 1;
    public static int DEBUG = 2;
    public static int ERROR = 3;

    protected int level;
    protected Logger nextLogger;

    public void setNextLogger(Logger nextLogger) {
        this.nextLogger = nextLogger;
    }

    public void logMessage(int level, String message) {
        if (this.level <= level) {
            write(message);
        }
        if (nextLogger != null) {
            nextLogger.logMessage(level, message);
        }
    }

    protected abstract void write(String message);
}

class InfoLogger extends Logger {
    public InfoLogger(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }

    @Override
    protected void write(String message) {
        System.out.println("INFO Logger: " + message);
    }
}

class DebugLogger extends Logger {
    public DebugLogger(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }

    @Override
    protected void write(String message) {
        System.out.println("DEBUG Logger: " + message);
    }
}

class ErrorLogger extends Logger {
    public ErrorLogger(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }

    @Override
    protected void write(String message) {
        System.out.println("ERROR Logger: " + message);
    }
}

public class LoggerChain {
    public static Logger getChainOfLoggers() {
        Logger errorLogger = new ErrorLogger(Logger.ERROR);
        Logger debugLogger = new DebugLogger(Logger.DEBUG);
        Logger infoLogger = new InfoLogger(Logger.INFO);

        infoLogger.setNextLogger(debugLogger);
        debugLogger.setNextLogger(errorLogger);

        return infoLogger;
    }
}

public class ChainPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Logger loggerChain = LoggerChain.getChainOfLoggers();

        System.out.println("Logging at INFO level:");
        loggerChain.logMessage(Logger.INFO, "This is an information.");

        System.out.println("\nLogging at DEBUG level:");
        loggerChain.logMessage(Logger.DEBUG, "This is a debug level information.");

        System.out.println("\nLogging at ERROR level:");
        loggerChain.logMessage(Logger.ERROR, "This is an error information.");
    }
}


Explanation:

Logger Interface (Logger):
Defines an interface for handling log requests and sets the logging level and the next logger in the chain.
logMessage method checks if the current logger can handle the request based on the log level. If it can, it processes the request; otherwise, it passes the request to the next logger in the chain.

Concrete Loggers (InfoLogger, DebugLogger, ErrorLogger):
Implement the Logger interface and handle log requests for specific log levels.

Chain Setup (LoggerChain):
Creates the chain of loggers by setting the next logger in the chain for each logger.

Client Code (ChainPatternDemo):
Demonstrates how to use the chain of loggers. It logs messages at different levels, and each message is handled by the appropriate logger in the chain.



This code defines the logger system using the Chain of Responsibility pattern, where each logger (InfoLogger, DebugLogger, ErrorLogger) handles messages of its respective level and passes any unhandled messages to the next logger in the chain. The LoggerChain class sets up the chain, and the ChainPatternDemo class demonstrates how to use it.


Advantages of the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
Decoupling of Objects: The pattern makes enables sending a request to a series of possible recipients without having to worry about which object will handle it in the end. This lessens the reliance between items.
Flexibility and Extensibility: New handlers can be easily added or existing ones can be modified without affecting the client code. This promotes flexibility and extensibility within the system.
Dynamic Order of Handling: The sequence and order of handling requests can be changed dynamically during runtime, which allows adjustment of the processing logic as per the requirements.


Disadvantages of the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
Possible Unhandled Requests: The chain should be implemented correctly otherwise there is a chance that some requests might not get handled at all, which leads to unexpected behavior in the application.
Performance Overhead: The request will go through several handlers in the chain if it is lengthy and complicated, which could cause performance overhead. The processing logic of each handler has an effect on the systemâ€™s overall performance.
