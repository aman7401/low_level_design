The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

Real-world analogy of the Observer Design Pattern

Let us Imagine a scenario where the weather station is observed by various smart devices. The weather station maintains a list of registered devices. When there’s a change in weather conditions, the weather station notifies all devices about the update.


Subject: Maintains a list of observers, allows dynamic registration/unregistration, and notifies observers of state changes.

Observer: Defines an interface with an update method for receiving updates from the subject. Concrete observers implement this interface to react to changes.

ConcreteSubject: Specific implementation of the subject holding the actual state/data. Notifies observers when its state changes (e.g., a weather station).

ConcreteObserver: Implements the observer interface, registers with a concrete subject, and reacts to state changes by implementing the update method (e.g., a weather app on a smartphone).

```java 

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Observer Interface
interface Observer {
	void update(String weather);
}

// Subject Interface
interface Subject {
	void addObserver(Observer observer);
	void removeObserver(Observer observer);
	void notifyObservers();
}

// ConcreteSubject Class
class WeatherStation implements Subject {
	private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
	private String weather;

	@Override
	public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
		observers.add(observer);
	}

	@Override
	public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
		observers.remove(observer);
	}

	@Override
	public void notifyObservers() {
		for (Observer observer : observers) {
			observer.update(weather);
		}
	}

	public void setWeather(String newWeather) {
		this.weather = newWeather;
		notifyObservers();
	}
}

// ConcreteObserver Class
class PhoneDisplay implements Observer {
	private String weather;

	@Override
	public void update(String weather) {
		this.weather = weather;
		display();
	}

	private void display() {
		System.out.println("Phone Display: Weather updated - " + weather);
	}
}

// ConcreteObserver Class
class TVDisplay implements Observer {
	private String weather;

	@Override
	public void update(String weather) {
		this.weather = weather;
		display();
	}

	private void display() {
		System.out.println("TV Display: Weather updated - " + weather);
	}
}

// Usage Class
public class WeatherApp {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WeatherStation weatherStation = new WeatherStation();

		Observer phoneDisplay = new PhoneDisplay();
		Observer tvDisplay = new TVDisplay();

		weatherStation.addObserver(phoneDisplay);
		weatherStation.addObserver(tvDisplay);

		// Simulating weather change
		weatherStation.setWeather("Sunny");

		// Output:
		// Phone Display: Weather updated - Sunny
		// TV Display: Weather updated - Sunny
	}
}

```

When to use the Observer Design Pattern?

One-to-Many Dependence:
Use the Observer pattern when there is a one-to-many relationship between objects, and changes in one object should notify multiple dependent objects.
This is particularly useful when changes in one object need to propagate to several other objects without making them tightly coupled.

Decoupling:
Use the Observer pattern to achieve loose coupling between objects.
This allows the subject (publisher) and observers (subscribers) to interact without being aware of each other’s specific details. It promotes a flexible and maintainable system.

Dynamic Composition:
If you need to support dynamic composition of objects with runtime registration and deregistration of observers, the Observer pattern is suitable.
New observers can be added or existing ones removed without modifying the subject.

Event Handling:
The Observer pattern is often used in event handling systems.
When events occur in a system, observers (listeners) can react to those events without requiring the source of the events to have explicit knowledge of the observers.

When not to use the Observer Design Pattern?

Performance Overhead:
In scenarios where performance is critical and there is a concern about the overhead of managing and notifying multiple observers, the Observer pattern might not be the best choice.
It adds some runtime overhead due to maintaining the list of observers and notifying them.

Complexity for Simple Scenarios:
For simple scenarios where there are only a few objects that need to be notified of changes, using the Observer pattern might introduce unnecessary complexity.
In such cases, a direct approach might be more straightforward.
