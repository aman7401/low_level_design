The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. It promotes code reuse by encapsulating the common algorithmic structure in the superclass while allowing subclasses to provide concrete implementations for certain steps, thus enabling customization and flexibility.


Components of the Template Method Design Pattern


Abstract Class (or Interface)
Defines the template method and algorithm skeleton.
Includes abstract methods (hooks) for subclasses to implement and concrete methods common to all subclasses.

Template Method
Defines the algorithm structure and sequence of steps.
Often declared as final to prevent altering the structure.

Abstract (or Hook) Methods
Declared but not implemented in the abstract class.
Serve as placeholders for algorithm steps, to be implemented by subclasses.

Concrete Subclasses
Extend the abstract class and implement abstract methods.
Customize specific steps of the algorithm while preserving the overall structure.


Template Method Design Pattern example
Letâ€™s consider a scenario where we have a process for making different types of beverages, such as tea and coffee. While the overall process of making beverages is similar (e.g., boiling water, adding ingredients), the specific steps and ingredients vary for each type of beverage.


```java 

// Abstract class defining the template method
abstract class BeverageMaker {
	// Template method defining the overall process
	public final void makeBeverage() {
		boilWater();
		brew();
		pourInCup();
		addCondiments();
	}

	// Abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses
	abstract void brew();
	abstract void addCondiments();

	// Common methods
	void boilWater() {
		System.out.println("Boiling water");
	}

	void pourInCup() {
		System.out.println("Pouring into cup");
	}
}

// Concrete subclass for making tea
class TeaMaker extends BeverageMaker {
	// Implementing abstract methods
	@Override
	void brew() {
		System.out.println("Steeping the tea");
	}

	@Override
	void addCondiments() {
		System.out.println("Adding lemon");
	}
}

// Concrete subclass for making coffee
class CoffeeMaker extends BeverageMaker {
	// Implementing abstract methods
	@Override
	void brew() {
		System.out.println("Dripping coffee through filter");
	}

	@Override
	void addCondiments() {
		System.out.println("Adding sugar and milk");
	}
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Making tea:");
		BeverageMaker teaMaker = new TeaMaker();
		teaMaker.makeBeverage();

		System.out.println("\nMaking coffee:");
		BeverageMaker coffeeMaker = new CoffeeMaker();
		coffeeMaker.makeBeverage();
	}
}

```
When to Use the Template Method Design Pattern
Common Algorithm with Variations: When an algorithm has a common structure but varying steps, encapsulate common steps in a superclass and allow subclasses to override specific steps.

Code Reusability: For similar tasks in different contexts, promoting reuse by defining common steps in one place.

Enforcing Structure: To enforce a specific sequence of steps in an algorithm while allowing flexibility in certain parts.

Reducing Duplication: Centralize common behavior in the abstract class to avoid code duplication in subclasses.


When Not to Use the Template Method Design Pattern

Highly Variable Algorithms: When algorithms have minimal commonality and vary greatly, leading to excessive complexity.

Tight Coupling Between Steps: When steps are tightly coupled and changes in one step affect others, reducing flexibility.

Inflexibility with Runtime Changes: When frequent runtime changes in algorithm structure or steps are needed, as the pattern relies on predefined structure.

Overhead in Abstraction: When the abstraction and inheritance costs outweigh the benefits, opt for simpler solutions.
