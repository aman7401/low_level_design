The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful when an object’s behavior depends on its state, and the state can change during the object’s lifecycle.

Components of the State Design Pattern
Context: Contains the object whose behavior changes with its state. Maintains a reference to the current state and delegates state-specific behavior to this state object.

State Interface/Base Class: Defines a common interface for all concrete state classes, declaring methods representing state-specific behavior. Enables the Context to interact with state objects without knowing their concrete types.

Concrete States: Implement the State interface or extend the base class, encapsulating behavior for a specific state. Define how the Context behaves in their respective states.


Real-World Analogy of State Design Pattern

Imagine a traffic light as a robot. It has different moods like “Stop” (Red), “Get Ready” (Yellow), and “Go” (Green).

The robot changes its mood based on the time or if cars are waiting.
When it’s “Stop”, cars stop, and people can walk. When it’s “Get Ready”, it’s about to change. And when it’s “Go”, cars can drive.

This setup makes it easy to add new moods or change how the robot behaves without messing up everything else. So, it’s like having a robot traffic light that knows when to stop, get ready, or go!


Example of State Design Pattern
Imagine a vending machine that sells various products. The vending machine needs to manage different states such as ready to serve, waiting for product selection, processing payment, and handling out-of-stock situations. Design a system that models the behavior of this vending machine efficiently.

```java 

interface VendingMachineState {
	void handleRequest();
}

class ReadyState implements VendingMachineState {
	@Override
	public void handleRequest() {
		System.out.println("Ready state: Please select a product.");
	}
}

class ProductSelectedState implements VendingMachineState {
	@Override
	public void handleRequest() {
		System.out.println("Product selected state: Processing payment.");
	}
}

class PaymentPendingState implements VendingMachineState {
	@Override
	public void handleRequest() {
		System.out.println("Payment pending state: Dispensing product.");
	}
}

class OutOfStockState implements VendingMachineState {
	@Override
	public void handleRequest() {
		System.out.println("Out of stock state: Product unavailable. Please select another product.");
	}
}

class VendingMachineContext {
	private VendingMachineState state;

	public void setState(VendingMachineState state) {
		this.state = state;
	}

	public void request() {
		state.handleRequest();
	}
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Create context
		VendingMachineContext vendingMachine = new VendingMachineContext();

		// Set initial state
		vendingMachine.setState(new ReadyState());

		// Request state change
		vendingMachine.request();

		// Change state
		vendingMachine.setState(new ProductSelectedState());

		// Request state change
		vendingMachine.request();

		// Change state
		vendingMachine.setState(new PaymentPendingState());

		// Request state change
		vendingMachine.request();

		// Change state
		vendingMachine.setState(new OutOfStockState());

		// Request state change
		vendingMachine.request();
	}
}

Output 
Ready state: Please select a product.
Product selected state: Processing payment.
Payment pending state: Dispensing product.
Out of stock state: Product unavailable. Please select another product.

Communication between Components in the above example:

When a user interacts with the vending machine (Context), such as inserting money or selecting a product, the vending machine delegates the responsibility of handling the interaction to the current state object.

The current state object (e.g., “ReadyState” or “ProductSelectedState”) executes the behavior associated with that state, such as processing the payment or dispensing the selected product.

Depending on the outcome of the interaction and the logic implemented within the current state object, the vending machine may transition to a different state.

The process continues as the user interacts further with the vending machine, with behavior delegated to the appropriate state object based on the current state of the vending machine.

When to Use the State Design Pattern

Multiple States with Distinct Behaviors: When an object exists in several states (e.g., On/Off, Open/Closed) with unique behaviors.

Complex Conditional Logic: When extensive conditional statements (if-else or switch-case) become unwieldy, organizing state-specific behavior into classes enhances readability and maintainability.

Frequent State Changes: When an object transitions between states frequently, the State pattern manages these transitions clearly.

Adding New States Easily: When you need to add new states in the future, the State pattern allows you to create new state classes without affecting existing ones.


When Not to Use the State Design Pattern

Few States with Simple Behavior: If the object has only a few states with minimal differences, simpler conditional logic may suffice without the overhead of the State pattern.

Performance-Critical Scenarios: The State pattern can introduce additional object creation and method calls, which may impact performance. If performance is crucial, consider other approaches.

Over-Engineering Simple Problems: Avoid using the State pattern just for the sake of using a design pattern. If your logic is already clear and maintainable, stick with the simpler solution.
