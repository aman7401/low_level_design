The Strategy Design Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing clients to switch algorithms dynamically without altering the code structure.

Components of the Strategy Design Pattern

Context
Holds a reference to a strategy and delegates tasks to it.
Interfaces between the client and strategy, enabling interchangeable strategies.

Strategy Interface
Defines methods that all concrete strategies must implement.
Ensures all strategies follow the same rules and can be used interchangeably.

Concrete Strategies
Implement the Strategy Interface with specific algorithms.
Encapsulate their algorithms and provide task execution methods.

Client
Selects and configures the appropriate strategy.
Creates and passes the desired strategy to the Context for task execution.

Real-World Analogy of Strategy Design Pattern
Imagine youâ€™re planning a trip to a new city, and you have several options for getting there: by car, by train, or by plane. Each mode of transportation offers its own set of advantages and disadvantages, depending on factors such as cost, travel time, and convenience.


```java

// SortingContext.java
class SortingContext {
	private SortingStrategy sortingStrategy;

	public SortingContext(SortingStrategy sortingStrategy) {
		this.sortingStrategy = sortingStrategy;
	}

	public void setSortingStrategy(SortingStrategy sortingStrategy) {
		this.sortingStrategy = sortingStrategy;
	}

	public void performSort(int[] array) {
		sortingStrategy.sort(array);
	}
}

// SortingStrategy.java
interface SortingStrategy {
	void sort(int[] array);
}

// BubbleSortStrategy.java
class BubbleSortStrategy implements SortingStrategy {
	@Override
	public void sort(int[] array) {
		// Implement Bubble Sort algorithm
		System.out.println("Sorting using Bubble Sort");
		// Actual Bubble Sort Logic here
	}
}

// MergeSortStrategy.java
class MergeSortStrategy implements SortingStrategy {
	@Override
	public void sort(int[] array) {
		// Implement Merge Sort algorithm
		System.out.println("Sorting using Merge Sort");
		// Actual Merge Sort Logic here
	}
}

// QuickSortStrategy.java
class QuickSortStrategy implements SortingStrategy {
	@Override
	public void sort(int[] array) {
		// Implement Quick Sort algorithm
		System.out.println("Sorting using Quick Sort");
		// Actual Quick Sort Logic here
	}
}

// Client.java
public class Client {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Create SortingContext with BubbleSortStrategy
		SortingContext sortingContext = new SortingContext(new BubbleSortStrategy());
		int[] array1 = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5};
		sortingContext.performSort(array1); // Output: Sorting using Bubble Sort

		// Change strategy to MergeSortStrategy
		sortingContext.setSortingStrategy(new MergeSortStrategy());
		int[] array2 = {8, 3, 7, 4, 2};
		sortingContext.performSort(array2); // Output: Sorting using Merge Sort

		// Change strategy to QuickSortStrategy
		sortingContext.setSortingStrategy(new QuickSortStrategy());
		int[] array3 = {6, 1, 3, 9, 5};
		sortingContext.performSort(array3); // Output: Sorting using Quick Sort
	}
}

When to Use the Strategy Design Pattern
Multiple Algorithms: For interchangeable algorithms (e.g., different sorting methods).

Encapsulating Algorithms: To separate algorithm implementation from the context, aiding maintenance and testing.

Runtime Selection: For dynamically switching algorithms based on user preferences or system states.

Reducing Conditional Statements: To eliminate multiple conditionals in a class, improving modularity.

Testing and Extensibility: For easier unit testing and extending the system with new algorithms without altering existing code.


When Not to Use the Strategy Design Pattern
Single Algorithm: If only one fixed algorithm is needed, avoid unnecessary complexity.

Overhead: If the pattern's complexity outweighs its benefits, especially in simple scenarios.

Inflexible Context: If the context class tightly depends on a single algorithm, avoid unnecessary abstraction.
