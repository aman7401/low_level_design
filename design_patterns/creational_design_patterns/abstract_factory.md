The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes, in simpler terms the Abstract Factory Pattern is a way of organizing how you create groups of things that are related to each other.


Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern and is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern.
Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.
Abstract factory pattern implementation provides us with a framework that allows us to create objects that follow a general pattern.
So at runtime, the abstract factory is coupled with any desired concrete factory which can create objects of the desired type.

```java
Sample Code for Abstarct factory method

// Abstract Factory Interface
interface CarFactory {
	Car createCar();
	CarSpecification createSpecification();
}

// Concrete Factory for North America Cars
class NorthAmericaCarFactory implements CarFactory {
	public Car createCar() {
		return new Sedan();
	}

	public CarSpecification createSpecification() {
		return new NorthAmericaSpecification();
	}
}

// Concrete Factory for Europe Cars
class EuropeCarFactory implements CarFactory {
	public Car createCar() {
		return new Hatchback();
	}

	public CarSpecification createSpecification() {
		return new EuropeSpecification();
	}
}

// Abstract Product Interface for Cars
interface Car {
	void assemble();
}

// Abstract Product Interface for Car Specifications
interface CarSpecification {
	void display();
}

// Concrete Product for Sedan Car
class Sedan implements Car {
	public void assemble() {
		System.out.println("Assembling Sedan car.");
	}
}

// Concrete Product for Hatchback Car
class Hatchback implements Car {
	public void assemble() {
		System.out.println("Assembling Hatchback car.");
	}
}

// Concrete Product for North America Car Specification
class NorthAmericaSpecification implements CarSpecification {
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("North America Car Specification: Safety features compliant with local regulations.");
	}
}

// Concrete Product for Europe Car Specification
class EuropeSpecification implements CarSpecification {
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("Europe Car Specification: Fuel efficiency and emissions compliant with EU standards.");
	}
}


// Client Code
public class CarFactoryClient {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Creating cars for North America
		CarFactory northAmericaFactory = new NorthAmericaCarFactory();
		Car northAmericaCar = northAmericaFactory.createCar();
		CarSpecification northAmericaSpec = northAmericaFactory.createSpecification();

		northAmericaCar.assemble();
		northAmericaSpec.display();

		// Creating cars for Europe
		CarFactory europeFactory = new EuropeCarFactory();
		Car europeCar = europeFactory.createCar();
		CarSpecification europeSpec = europeFactory.createSpecification();

		europeCar.assemble();
		europeSpec.display();
	}
}



Output
Assembling Sedan car.
North America Car Specification: Safety features compliant with local regulations.
Assembling Hatchback car.
Europe Car Specification: Fuel efficiency and emissions compliant wit...


When to use Abstract Factory Pattern
Multiple families of related products: When your system needs to be configured with multiple families of related products, and you want to ensure that the products from one family are compatible with the products from another family.



Abstract Factory Method: Pros and Cons

The Abstract Factory Method builds upon the Factory Method, offering more control over creating families of related objects. Here's a quick rundown:

Advantages:

Flexibility: Easily introduce new families of products without modifying client code.
Consistency: Ensures compatibility within product families.
Encapsulation: Hides object creation logic and product dependencies.
Disadvantages:

Complexity: Increased number of classes compared to simpler approaches.
Rigidity: Adding new product types to existing families can be challenging.
Overkill: Might be unnecessary for applications with single product types.
