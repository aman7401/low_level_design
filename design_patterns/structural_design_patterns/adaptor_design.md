The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making them work together. This pattern involves a single class, known as the adapter, which is responsible for joining functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.

```java

// Target Interface
public interface Printer {
    void print(String text);
}

// Adaptee
public class OldPrinter {
    public void printDocument(String text) {
        System.out.println("Old Printer is printing: " + text);
    }
}

// Adapter
public class PrinterAdapter implements Printer {
    private OldPrinter oldPrinter;

    public PrinterAdapter(OldPrinter oldPrinter) {
        this.oldPrinter = oldPrinter;
    }

    @Override
    public void print(String text) {
        oldPrinter.printDocument(text);
    }
}

// Client Code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OldPrinter oldPrinter = new OldPrinter();
        Printer printerAdapter = new PrinterAdapter(oldPrinter);

        // Client using the adapter to print
        printerAdapter.print("Hello, Adapter Pattern!");
    }
}

When to Use the Adapter Design Pattern

Legacy Code Integration:
Use Case: Integrate legacy systems with incompatible interfaces.
Example: An old printing system with a printDocument method.

Third-Party Library Integration:
Use Case: Use third-party libraries with different interfaces.
Example: Third-party logging library with a logMessage method.

Class Interface Incompatibility:
Use Case: Make incompatible classes work together.
Example: GUI component and data source with different interfaces.

Reusing Existing Classes:
Use Case: Reuse classes with necessary functionality but different interfaces.
Example: Legacy data processing class in a new module.

Simplifying Client Code:
Use Case: Provide a unified interface for complex subsystems.
Example: Simplify a graphics libraryâ€™s methods.

Standardizing Interfaces:
Use Case: Standardize interfaces for similar functionalities.
Example: Different payment gateways with varying APIs.



When Not to Use the Adapter Design Pattern

Unnecessary Complexity:
Scenario: Interfaces are already compatible.
Reason: Adds maintenance overhead.

Performance Overhead:
Scenario: Performance-sensitive applications.
Reason: Additional abstraction layer degrades performance.

Frequent Interface Changes:
Scenario: Rapidly evolving APIs.
Reason: High maintenance costs.

Simpler Solutions Available:
Scenario: Direct modifications are feasible.
Reason: Avoid over-engineering.
